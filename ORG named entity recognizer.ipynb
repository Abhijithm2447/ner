    "# mInsightText = [\"\"\"Paresh Dandona, MD, PhD, SUNY Distinguished Professor, Chief of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, SUNY at Buffalo Founder and Director, Diabetes and Endocrinology Center of Western New York presented Novel Treatments of Type 1 Diabetes: Recent Advances at the Cleveland Clinic 24th Annual Diabetes Day. Speaker discussed liraglutide as the first GLP-1 RA that worked 24 hours and had MOA other than on b-cell to improve glucose control in T1DM. Stated lira provided more predictability in blood sugars for patients as well as decrease in post-prandial insulin dose and decrease in body weight and shown to have glucagon suppression. Shared that lira has shown the potential to be insulin sensitizing due to decrease in inflammatory cells and Novo investigating the decrease in SBP and the RAS. Stated A1c reduction is modest but QOL of patient is improved due to the predictability of blood sugars. Presented quoted a JDRF study not yet published that is investigating lira in obese T1DM subjects which has demonstrated a significant decrease in weight, body fat (while maintaining lean muscle mass) which could provide a novel approach to obesity. Study also demonstrated decrease in adipose tissue, FFA, markers of oxidative stress, inflammatory markers while increasing metabolic activity of adipose tissue. An additional small GLP-1 RA study was referenced in C-peptide positive T1DM patients that showed islet preservation and decreased b-cell apoptosis and that 5/10 patients were able to go off insulin. Presenter went on to discuss the results of DEPICT 1 and 2 as well as Triple Therapy in Type 1 Diabetes (Insulin plus GLP-1 plus SGLT-2 Inhibitor dapagliflozin). The hypothesis would be to investigate if triple therapy could further improve glucose control in T1DM and since liraglutide suppresses glucagon and lowers FFA while SGLT-2 inhibitors increase glucagon and risk of DKA, is it possible that the combination of the two agents may neutralize the DKA risk. The investigators conclusions were: 1. the addition of dapagliflozin (10mg/day) to insulin and liraglutide in T1D results in a significant improvement in glycemia as reflected in both HbA1c and glucose concentrations along with significant weight loss 2. There is also a concomitant increase in plasma glucagon concentrations, lipolysis and FFA, which provides the substrate for ketogenesis, with an increase in acetoacetate and b-hydroxybutyrate concentrations 3. The increase in glucagon and FFA by dapagliflozin occurred in spite of the presence of liraglutide, which was shown to suppress both 4. Achieved insulin doses are adequate to manage glycemia but it may not be sufficient to adequately perform its other physiological functions including suppression of lipolysis and ketogenesis 5. The increased lipolysis in association with low insulin doses may increase the risk of DKA. (Kuhadiya ND, Ghanim H, Mehta A, Garg M, Khan S, et al. (2016) Dapagliflozin as Additional Treatment to Liraglutide and Insulin in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes. The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism 101(9): 3506-3515.)Speaker referenced data that came out last week that 90% of patients with T1DM have measurable pro-insulin and since liraglutide stimulates pro-insulin there may be a potential role in the future for the molecule in this aspect.\"\"\",\n",

He called, today, Aprll 13th and here's his feedback: 1.) When asked for his initial thoughts: He responded first by asking \"How is BI looking at the study\", then added that to him as a clinical pulmonologist, \"I think I need more data and or clinical experience\" to make a better decision on the trial results. He said that there were many good things in regard to the size of the patient pool, the length of the study and the numerical results, yet he mentioned that without a washout period of significant time and results/discussion regarding patients on ICS or not on ICS and/or antibiotics still left some doubt in his mind\"\"\"]\n",
